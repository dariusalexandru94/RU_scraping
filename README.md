# Scraping for Putin's close associates
https://www.spisok-putina.org/

The website (https://www.spisok-putina.org/) **“PUTIN’S LIST”** is created by the Free Russia Forum in order **to search, consolidate and unify data** on 
those responsible for creating and running a system of unchecked power and suppressing civil liberties both in Russia and abroad.

The project aims to gather information related to persons of the following categories:

* The **“POWER-HOLDERS”** of Russia, who seized and unlawfully hold power in the country;
* The **“EXECUTORS”**, who, as public servants and MPs, directly implement the Kremlin’s policy of felonious retention of power in the country;
* The **“TRANSGRESSORS”**, from among the judges, prosecutors, investigators, lawyers, law enforcement officers and their agents responsible for the direct implementation of the repression and prosecution of the opposition;
* The **“AGGRESSORS”**, who are responsible for carrying out the policies of war, occupation and chaos against other countries, in violation of international law, in the political interests of the leadership of the country;
* The **“BENEFICIARIES”**, foreign partners of the Russian government who contribute to the implementation of its felonious plans to undermine international law and global peace, justice and democracy.
* The **“OLIGARCHS AND CORRUPT OFFICIALS”**, who are responsible for plundering Russia on a state-wide scale, by direct membership in the Russian government or proximity to it through relatives and other proxies;
* The **“PROPAGANDISTS”**, who are responsible for creating and disseminating state information, deliberately deceiving people in the interests of the political leadership and creating an atmosphere of widespread hatred and intolerance;
* The **“ACCOMPLICES”**, who reap personal profit from cooperation with government authorities, to the detriment of the interests of the country and its citizens;
