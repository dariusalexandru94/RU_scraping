# Scraping for Putin's close associates
https://www.spisok-putina.org/

The website (https://www.spisok-putina.org/) **“PUTIN’S LIST”** is created by the Free Russia Forum in order **to search, consolidate and unify data** on 
those responsible for creating and running a system of unchecked power and suppressing civil liberties both in Russia and abroad.

The project aims to gather information related to persons of the following categories:

* The **“POWER-HOLDERS”** of Russia, who seized and unlawfully hold power in the country;
* The **“EXECUTORS”**, who, as public servants and MPs, directly implement the Kremlin’s policy of felonious retention of power in the country;
* The **“TRANSGRESSORS”**, from among the judges, prosecutors, investigators, lawyers, law enforcement officers and their agents responsible for the direct implementation of the repression and prosecution of the opposition;
* The **“AGGRESSORS”**, who are responsible for carrying out the policies of war, occupation and chaos against other countries, in violation of international law, in the political interests of the leadership of the country;
* The **“BENEFICIARIES”**, foreign partners of the Russian government who contribute to the implementation of its felonious plans to undermine international law and global peace, justice and democracy.
* The **“OLIGARCHS AND CORRUPT OFFICIALS”**, who are responsible for plundering Russia on a state-wide scale, by direct membership in the Russian government or proximity to it through relatives and other proxies;
* The **“PROPAGANDISTS”**, who are responsible for creating and disseminating state information, deliberately deceiving people in the interests of the political leadership and creating an atmosphere of widespread hatred and intolerance;
* The **“ACCOMPLICES”**, who reap personal profit from cooperation with government authorities, to the detriment of the interests of the country and its citizens;

# Legal entities under sanctions with names and addresses

Here https://sanctions.blackseanews.net/en I have found a list with **every Russian sanctioned entity that includes addresses and dates** since sanctions started taking effect.
Among other data transformations, **this script also includes translating from Russian to the Latin alphabet**.

# Russian trolls scraper using twint

"Twint" is an open-source Python library used for scraping and collecting data from Twitter. The name "Twint" stands for "Twitter Intelligence Tool." It allows users to gather public tweets, user profiles, followers, and other Twitter-related data without requiring access to the Twitter API.

# Scraping equipment losses with sources

The original source of this aggregated data is from this OSINT project: **Attack On Europe: Documenting Russian Equipment Losses During The Russian Invasion Of Ukraine**. The website is: https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html. I chose to aggregate the data in a different manner than the one presented on the source website, in order to better align with my analysis interests.

# Scraping sanctions information on Russia - chronologically

I have scraped a list with information regarding the sanctions applied to the Russian Federation since the beginning of the conflict. This list can be found on the official website of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine:

# Ukraine’s military intelligence list of ru FSB officers

Ukraine’s military intelligence on 28 March 2022 published the names and contact details of 620 people it alleged were **officers of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB)** involved in “criminal activities” in Europe.

The list is available on the official webpage of the Ukrainian Military Intelligence Service:
* https://gur.gov.ua/content/sotrudnyky-fsb-rossyy-uchastvuiushchye-v-prestupnoi-deiatelnosty-stranyahressora-na-terrytoryy-evropy.html

Next to the names there is data that the Ukrainian special service claims to contain **date of birth, passport, address registration, debts, SIM cards, modems, cars, special remarks and more**. All 620 agents are registered at the same address – Bolshaya Lubyanka Street in Moscow, the address of FSB, the former KGB.
